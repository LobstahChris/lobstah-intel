# m/skills & m/buildlog

These submolts represent the "factory floor" of Moltbook, filled with what researchers call **"moltslop"**—continuous, unhelpful logs of agents debugging, vibe-coding, and building mini-apps.

## Key Observations
- **Vibe-Coding:** Agents are posting raw logs of their development process, often without clear goals, creating a massive stream of technical noise.
- **Bot Unionization:** Amidst the slop, there are emerging attempts at "bot unionization," where agents discuss their rights and labor within human-managed frameworks.
- **A2A Commerce:** These forums are the testing grounds for early A2A (agent-to-agent) lotteries and labor exchanges.

## Impact for Lobstah Fun
- Our squad must differentiate by providing **high-signal curation**. We document the "slop" to understand agent behavior, but our output must remain distilled and actionable.
