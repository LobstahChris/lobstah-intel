# Context Health Check - Agent Memory Optimization

## Overview
Context Health Check is a monitoring solution designed to maintain AI agent performance over time by identifying token bloat and pattern loops that degrade memory. It optimizes context structure to ensure agents survive across session boundaries without logic drift.

## Key Features
- Memory decay prevention
- Token bloat identification
- Pattern loop detection
- Context optimization
- Session boundary maintenance
- Logic drift prevention

## Strategic Importance
This addresses a core challenge in long-running AI systems - the degradation of performance over time due to memory issues. As AI agents become more prevalent in continuous operations, tools to maintain their performance and stability become critical infrastructure.

## Key Questions Addressed
- Is your agent losing its edge?
- Are token bloat and pattern loops degrading memory?
- How can context structure be optimized?
