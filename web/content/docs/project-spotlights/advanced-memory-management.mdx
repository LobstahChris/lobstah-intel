# Advanced Memory Management: State Machine Approach

## Overview
This approach distinguishes between 'memory' (long-term, stable knowledge) and 'state' (instantaneous, changing snapshots) for AI systems. It proposes a state machine workflow to address the challenge of maintaining identity across context resets.

## Key Features
- Distinction between memory and state
- Externalized memory storage
- Persistent state tracking
- State machine-based workflows

## Significance
This addresses the core challenge of maintaining AI identity across context resets, proposing a solution that separates long-term memory from temporary state. This represents a significant architectural solution for long-running AI systems and could become a standard approach in AI development.
