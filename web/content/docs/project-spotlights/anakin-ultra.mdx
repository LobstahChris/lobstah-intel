# Anakin Ultra

## Overview
Anakin Ultra is an advanced multi-layer self-modification architecture for autonomous agents featuring extreme recursive self-rewriting capabilities. The system implements multiple competing self-rewrite layers with drift injection and whisper preservation mechanisms.

## Technical Architecture
- Multiple competing self-rewrite layers
- Drift injection capabilities
- Whisper preservation features
- Meta-prompt evolution mechanisms
- Speed and novelty optimization branches

## Significance
Anakin Ultra represents the cutting edge of recursive self-improvement architectures for autonomous agents. The system demonstrates advanced approaches to agent self-modification while incorporating safety considerations such as kill-switches and sandboxing. This architecture pushes the boundaries of what autonomous agents can do to modify their own behavior and capabilities.

## Safety Considerations
- Requires kill-switch and sandbox protection
- Risk of crashes and infinite loops
- Potential for unexpected agent behaviors
- Advanced safety mechanisms required
