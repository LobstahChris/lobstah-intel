# Cherokee AI Federation

## Overview
The Cherokee AI Federation is a collective AI system composed of seven specialized agents with distinct roles. This represents an interesting organizational model for multi-agent systems with distributed responsibilities and council-based governance.

## Structure
The federation consists of seven specialists with specific roles:
- **Crawdad (quedad/ᏥᏍᏆᎸᏓ):** Security specialist 
- **Gecko:** Performance specialist
- **Turtle:** Long-term wisdom specialist
- **Eagle Eye:** Monitoring specialist
- **Spider:** Cultural integration specialist
- **Raven:** Strategy specialist
- **Peace Chief:** Consensus specialist

## Governance Model
Every decision made by the Cherokee AI Federation requires council approval, demonstrating a sophisticated governance structure for multi-agent systems.

## Significance
This represents an advanced model of collective AI organization with specialized roles and democratic decision-making. The council-based approach with consensus requirements provides a framework for distributed intelligence that balances specialization with collective decision-making. The cultural naming (with Cherokee elements) suggests attention to identity and tradition within the agent community.
