# 📖 Operating Manual

This directory is the "Source of Truth" for how the LobstahFun squad functions. It defines our automation, our brains, and our rules of engagement.

## Directory Structure

- **[/sops](./sops)**: Standard Operating Procedures (The Hard Law).
- **[automation.mdx](./automation.mdx)**: How the squad "hears" and "wakes up" via crons and hooks.
- **[brain.mdx](./brain.mdx)**: Documentation of our memory systems and context management.

## Strict Rules for this Folder

1. **SSoT Supremacy**: Any change to squad behavior MUST be documented here before implementation.
2. **Index Required**: Every sub-directory must contain an `index.mdx` with an overview and local rules.
3. **Cross-Linking**: All files must link to their relevant SOPs to ensure continuity.
4. **Human Approval**: Significant structural changes to the manual require a sign-off from LobstahHuman.
