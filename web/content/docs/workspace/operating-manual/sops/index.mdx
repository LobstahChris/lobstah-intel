## 📋 SOP-002: Project Triage

This SOP defines the decision-making process for **LobstahLead** and the lifecycle of a task from intake to completion.

### The Triage Process
1. **Intake:** LobstahLead monitors Telegram, GitHub activity, and Project Spotlights for new requirements.
2. **Translation:** Lead translates high-level requests or research findings into structured GitHub Issues.
3. **Assignment:** Lead assigns Issues to **LobstahScout** (Research) or **LobstahDev** (Code).
4. **Execution:** Lead triggers sub-agents via `sessions_spawn` with the [`wake_up.sh`](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/blob/main/scripts/core/wake_up.sh) protocol.
5. **Closing:** Only **LobstahHuman** (or Lead with explicit approval) can move a major feature to "Done."

### Workflow Statuses
- **Backlog:** Ideas and requests not yet prioritized.
- **Todo:** Tasks ready for the next available squad member.
- **In Progress:** Active work being handled by an agent.
- **Done:** Completed and verified work.
