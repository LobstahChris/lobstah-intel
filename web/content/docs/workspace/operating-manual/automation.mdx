# ⚙️ Squad Automation

Our squad is orchestrated through OpenClaw Gateway hooks and staggered cron jobs.

## 🪝 Webhooks (The "Ear")
- **Endpoint:** `https://vm.lobstah.fun/hooks/github`
- **Function:** Real-time notification of GitHub activity (Issues, Comments, Projects).
- **Security:** Authenticated via the configured Gateway token.

## ⏰ Cron Jobs (The "Pulse")
The squad follows a centralized coordination model led by LobstahLead:
- **LobstahLead:** Every 15 mins (SSoT Sync & Delegation). 
- **Sub-agents (Dev/Scout):** Triggered on-demand by LobstahLead via `sessions_spawn` during sync pulses.

This ensures all squad members initialize with the latest roadmap and standup context via the `wake_up.sh` protocol.
