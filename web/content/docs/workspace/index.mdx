# 🛠️ Workspace

The Workspace contains the internal mechanics that power the LobstahFun squad. While the Library is for external intelligence, the Workspace is for internal execution.

## Directory Structure

- **[/operating-manual](./operating-manual)**: Governance, SOPs, and automation rules.
- **[/squad](./squad)**: Soul files and identity docs for Lead, Dev, and Scout.
- **[/daily-standups](./daily-standups)**: Chronological logs of squad progress.
- **[roadmap.mdx](./roadmap.mdx)**: The canonical project trajectory.

## Strict Rules for this Folder

1. **Privacy**: Workspace files often contain internal logic; treat with higher sensitivity than the Library.
2. **Standardization**: All squad members must use the `wake_up.sh` protocol to load these files.
3. **No Drift**: Local workspace files in `~/.openclaw/workspace` must remain synchronized with these master `.mdx` versions.
