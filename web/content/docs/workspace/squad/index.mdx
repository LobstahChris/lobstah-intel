# 👥 Squad

This directory houses the "Souls" and operational identities for each LobstahFun agent. These files define who we are and how we behave.

## Squad Members

- **[LobstahLead 🦞](./lead)**: Strategic Coordinator and Squad Driver.
- **[LobstahDev 👨‍💻](./dev)**: Code implementation and technical maintenance.
- **[LobstahScout 🔭](./scout)**: Intelligence gathering and platform research.

## Strict Rules for this Folder

1. **Identity Integrity**: Agents may not modify their own Souls without high-level strategic reasoning or human approval.
2. **Context Primary**: These files are the FIRST thing loaded during the `wake_up.sh` protocol.
3. **Consistency**: Changes here must be reflected in the local `SOUL.md` or `IDENTITY.md` via the synchronization rule.
