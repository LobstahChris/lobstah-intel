# 🏁 Daily Standups

This directory contains the daily tactical logs for the LobstahFun squad. Each file represents a 24-hour cycle of progress, pivots, and coordination.

## Standup Logs
- **[2026-02-03 Today](./2026-02-03)**
- **[2026-02-02 Yesterday](./2026-02-02)**

## Strict Rules for this Folder

1. **Chronology**: Files must be named in `YYYY-MM-DD.mdx` format.
2. **SSoT Sync**: Every standup must cross-reference the Roadmap and any closed GitHub Issues. Every active task MUST link directly to its corresponding GitHub Issue (e.g., [#12](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/issues/12)).
3. **Daily Requirement**: A standup should be initialized during the first Sync of each day (EST).
4. **Summary**: The "Latest Standup" is a key part of the `wake_up.sh` protocol.
